this is a card game called spell tactics
_

it is about joy

the joy to outplay and the joy to be outplayed

it is about the appreciation of great turns and the thrilling moment of uncertainty just before the reveal of combat outcome
_

we get right into it:

this is a two player game, you both start with 13 health

your goal is to bring your opponent's health down to zero while being above zero health yourself

both players each have a deck with 6 cards, discard pile, hand, and a playing zone with three different fields
_

each of those three fields has a different effect if you place a card in it:

    attack field:     damage your opponent
    block field:      lower damage from your opponent, or reflect it back
    draw field:       draw cards from your deck, prevent your opponent to draw cards, or steal the card draw from your opponent


this is the game's structure:
    
    game with several rounds  (
        round with four phases  (
            play phase with three actions  (
                attack
                block
                draw
                )
            reveal phase and calculation
            clean up 
            draw phase and shuffling
            )
        )
_

you always play cards face down - simultaneously with your opponent

you can choose to play them either direct or charged

cards played directly will be revealed and calculated in the current round

charged cards will be revealed in the following round - until then the field the card is placed in is occupied and no other card can be played onto this field

the effect of charged cards are stronger and more consequential
